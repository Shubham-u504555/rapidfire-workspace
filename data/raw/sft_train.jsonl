There are two scenarios \nhere:\n1. not purchased check-in\nThe passengers haven't purchased the Check-in product. In that case, inside the Check-in tab there will be \navailable information on how to purchase the product (if it is possible) and how to check-in themselves \nmanually:\n\nApp Check-in: Here the passengers can ﬁnd information on how to request the check-in product via \nApp. The App check-in is a cost free service.\nCheck-in Service: Here the passengers can ﬁnd information on how to purchase the check-in product via \nthe Web site.\nSelf check-in: Here the passengers can ﬁnd information on how to check-in themselves manually. There \nis an itinerary of the trip showing the reference number (booking number), the airline and the email \naddress that should be used per ﬂight or group of ﬂights in order to check themselves in.\n2. Purchased check-in\nThe passengers have purchased the check-in product either via the App or the Web site. In that case the \npassengers should be able to see their check-in status per segment and per passenger, a section with \ninformation about their baggage and an FAQ section with common questions regarding the check-in.\n\nCheck-in status\n1. Already checked in\n2. Check-in status before registration in passNFly\nWhen the passengers request the check-in service for a speciﬁc order, the system tries initially try to register \nthis order in passNFly. In case the ﬁrst attempt fails, we try to register 2 more times. This process may take up \nto 10 minutes. If the registration fails even after these 3 attempts the request goes to a queue and needs to \nbe manually resolved (instructions will be shared in a diﬀerent article). During this time we show the check-in \nstatus for all passengers as pending. \n\n3. Failed check-in \nIf the registration failure has still not been resolved until the check-in window opens (e.g. 24 hours before the \ndeparture), then the check-in status is updated to failed and we prompt the passengers to manually check-in \nthemselves.\nThe check-in can fail for multiple reasons. It could be either due to passNFly internal issues etc. (FAILED \nstatus in passNFly) or some missing traveler documents for the passengers (SUSPENED status in passNFly). \nOn our side, for all these failures we show \"Failed check-in\" text as the passenger's status, but we provide \nmore information next to it.\n\n4. Check-in status when temporary server error occurs\nIn case of communication error with passNFly (server error on their side etc), we display the itinerary of the \ntrip but at the same time inform the passengers that their check-in status is temporarily unavailable.\n**** if a customer calls and requests info about the check-in , the FL agents can login to the Myportal to\ncheck the status of the check-in. In this case, there is no need to escalate the request through the op-supp-\nancillaries slack channel. \nPlease keep in mind that :\nApp check-in - will be available only on 3 main brands (Mytrip, Flightnetwork and Gotogate).\nCheck-in Service - only for those trips where we o\u0000er the check-in service for purchase.\nSelf check-in guidelines - will be available for all\n \nStep 4\nSolution Parent step: 1\nWhat’s included\nWe would like to inform you that a new section has been released in My Bookings, internally called 'What’s\nincluded.' For customers, it's named 'Your Products Overview.'\n\nIn this section, customers can view products, services, and their respective rules included in their order. Each\nproduct comes with a description and instructions on how to use it.\nBelow, you will \u0000nd examples of how the Included Products section appears for the customer:\n\nIf the customer clicks on the product, the drawer will open with more information.\nFor seats and meals, we specify the type of meal or the seat number the customer selected for each trip. \n\n\nAs you can see i", "output": "Summary: (model will learn)"}

Log in to the portal and retrieve the booking. \n2.  Click on \"Change Trip\":\n\n3. Select the new itinerary and the new travel date. Then select the new preferred \u0000ight:\n4. Once you select the new \u0000ight, at the right side of the page, you will be able to see the total cost of\nrebooking. \nNorwegian charges +3% of the cost for payments with VAN. Make sure to\ncalculate this cost as well before informing the customer.\n\nFor example, 650SEK * 0.03 =  19.5 SEK this amount should be charged in addition to the airline's cost.\nTherefore, the total cost to the customer for the above example will be 650 + 19.5 = 670 SEK.\n5. Proceed with charging the customer along with our fees (if applicable). \n\n6. Once the Customer pays, issue a VAN card and click on the \"Continue change\" button. \n7. On the next page, you will be able to recon\u0000rm the changes.

Use the\ntemplate titled ''External portal booking details'' located under folder First Line \u0000 Other.  \nStep 8\nSolution Parent step: 1\nNorwegian Airlines (DY) Corporate card fee\nWhenever you are using a corporate debit/credit card on the Norwegian website (DY), regardless of the\nrequest type (ex. name change, ancillary, etc), there is an extra fee of 3% which is added to the total price and\nappears in the last step of payment.\nTherefore, we need to charge the customers 3% as an additional fee in the total price when we are using our\ncorporate cards, otherwise, the price we collect from the passenger will be less than the price we are paying\nto the airlines. \nYou are able to see the policy mentioned by choosing the LCC-Norwegian tab in 'Edvin Documents':\n\nStep 9\nSolution Parent step: 2\nSC - Schedule change\nCheck Changes on the portal\nYou can \u0000nd more information regarding the schedule changes in the booking by clicking on below:\n“Original” is one that the passenger con\u0000rmed last, not when he bought the\nticket. For example, if two SC occurred, the “Original” will show the last segment\ncon\u0000rmed by the passenger.\n\nCheck OTRS\nAlways check for emails in Edvin - OTRS, if a passenger misses receiving one of them you can ask for the\n‘’Ancillary team’’  in the slack room to forward it again.\nAll schedule changes mail are forwarded to the passengers via a script:\nCon\u0000rm new \u0000ights/ Rebooking\nWhile you are on the Norwegian Portal -View changes, you are able to proceed as per passenger request with\ncon\u0000rmation of the \u0000ights or \u0000nding other alternatives:\n\nC", "output": "Summary: (model will learn)"}

Customers call/email/chat to ask for cancellation on a voluntary basis. \n2. After standard security veri\u0000cation, proceed to ‘’Refund ‘’ tab in Edvin and press on ‘’Check Claimability ‘’\nas shown below.\nAttention! In case Edvin Calculator will not give a successful result proceed as per usual routine with checking\nif the booking is eligible for refund(check Edvin docs and fare rules), communicate airlines penalties, ETG fees\nif applicable, etc. \n3. The tool will automatically calculate the refundable amount and provide results based on the date of the\norder and date of customer's request for cancellation. \nYou may receive more than one o\u0000er results such as Void and 24h airline rule or 24h airline rule and Ticket\nrules, in such case you must always provide to the customer the o\u0000er with the highest amount.\nYou will also have a deadline when this refundable amount can be provided based on the ‘’Expires’’ \u0000eld.\nFor example, if the booking is eligible for refund due to void, the refundable amount will indicate ‘’VOID’’ as\ncancellation reason in the ‘’Source \u0000eld’’ as shown below and this o\u0000er is available until 25JUN23. \n\nThe deadline for customers to con\u0000rm cancellation is ALWAYS the previous day before departure, thus always\nyou must check if any restrictions occur, i.e. 24h rule.\nIn case the order is not eligible for Void, Edvin Calculator will calculate the potential refundable amount\nbased on ATC functionality.\n  \n Please note when you click on the button ‘’Show items’’ you will \u0000nd the breakdown of the refundable amount\nincluding the penalty that is applicable by the airline in the customer's currency and in GDS currency.\nConsequently, you should not check fare rules in GDS, the refund calculator will give you the airlines penalty.\n4. Inform the customer about the total refundable amount as shown in the ‘’Total’’ \u0000eld. For email/chat\ncommunication use the applicable templates/scripts. \n5. If a customer decides to cancel the order, copy the airline penalty amount  in the GDS currency as it must\nbe inserted in the ‘’Modify order'' wizard. The airline penalty is visible when you click on ''Show items''. \n6.  Use the ‘’Modify order’’ button with the applicable cancellation reason.\n7.

All related templates are available in the folder ‘’ATC Refund\nCalculator’’. The folder is located under First Line-> Cancellation. Same location is under’’ Booking.com’’\ntemplates. \n8.

In this instance, only the taxes are refundable, while the fare di\u0000erence is not. This\ninformation indicates the amount of taxes that could be refunded if you decide to proceed with the\nexchange. \nFor example, exchanging a nonrefundable Flex fare for a nonrefundable Standard fare at a lower cost would\nresult in forfeiting the fare di\u0000erence, with only the taxes being eligible for a refund upon exchange.\nRegarding the availability of the cabin: In some cases, when searching and rebooking for a new \u0000ight, a\nparticular cabin may not be available.\nFor example, the \u0000ight from YYC to YYZ or YUL both have Business cabin, the \u0000ight from YYZ or YUL to YFC only\nhas an economy cabin.\nAfter selecting the preferable \u0000ights, you may select additional services on both \u0000ights:\nAfter that, click “Continue” to review the new itineraries and inform the customer accordingly. \nAll the calculations are automated and provided by the portal.\n\nThe form of payment is VAN. Once payment has been received by the customer, continue with the\npayment on the portal.\nIn Edvin, for choosing the correct payment cart:\nWhen airlines require VAN as FOP, select:\nAirline Cost - Rebooking / New Ticket (LCC) NOT Flexible Ticket\nClick on “Con\u0000rm”.\nOnce the rebooking is con\u0000rmed, proceed with the rest actions in Edvin as per our normal routines as\nper this Shelf page: Sync Trip button, under customer trip \u0000eld.\nIf this is not possible, use the old routine: Send email conﬁrmation to customer from Edvin.

The reservations can be made via\nTravelfusion or TripStack system, which have a connection with the airlines.\n \nException:\nThere are some carriers shown as TravelFusion or Tripstack in Edvin, that are portals and not LCC. You can\nrecognize them from the purple banner. You may check all the portals here.\nDi\u0000erence between LCC and GDS\nNote that a ticket number will never be viewed on an LCC booking in Edvin, the clients use the LCC PNR to\ncheck in, see information on the booking con\u0000rmation.\nIt is marked in the booking process (at air search result and payment step) that the customer buying a\nticket with a low cost carrier and that special conditions will apply.\nAt the payment step customer have to agree and con\u0000rm the travel conditions (both ours and the\nairline's) \nStep 6\nSolution No linked steps\nOTRS\nWhen the customer completes a booking and has booked their ﬂight with an LCC airline, we create alias email\naddresses to access their bookings (exceptions apply, check at the bottom of the page). This means that when\nthe airline sends emails regarding anything (from advertisements to schedule changes), we receive them and\nnot the customer. We can therefore select which emails to forward to the customer and which not to.  \nThe email address used can be found on the conﬁrmation email or under the LCC tab in Edvin. \nConﬁrmation email :\nLCC tab in Edvin: \nThis way, we receive many emails and the ones that are important for the passenger to have are being resent\nto the passenger from this OTRS email. The booking con\u0000rmation is sent as usual from Edvin to all these\ncustomers.\nIf we have received an email from the airline regarding the LCC Booking, we are able to see it in Edvin under\nthe OTRS Tab:\nUnder \"latest action\" we can see if the email has been forwarded to the customer or not, and also the\ncategory shows what kind of information we have sent to the customer. \nWe can click on the subject line of the email and a new tab will open up where we can see the email that has\nbeen sent to the customer. \nYou can request from Ancillary team to resend the email from OTRS to pax, using slack room #op-supp-\nancillaries\nFor OU teams, please escalate to OUT Support through the Service desk.\n***Attention*** \nThe Alias email is not created for all the LCC (for example Ryanair is excluded etc).\nIn order to recognize if the booking was made with an Alias email or with the customer's actual email\naddress, go to the con\u0000rmation email and check which email address do we provide to the customer for\ncheck-in.\nIf it is the same email address as the one inserted in Edvin's contact details then it means that no Alias email\nwas created for this order. Instead, we used directly the customer's email address to make the booking.\nTherefore, no emails will have been received in the OTRS.\nStep 7\nSolution Parent step: 1\nFare Hike\nFare hike Guidelines can be found here.\nStep 8\nSolution Parent step: 1\nLCC Ancillaries and services\nPlease note that for LCC we can assist only with Ancillaries. If a passenger requests Assistance (eg.\nWheelchair), w", "output": "Summary: (model will learn)"}

When payment is collected\nCreate a VAN card in Edvin\nWhen VAN card is created go back to FLX: \n7. Choose the traveler that you want to issue baggage for and press next:\nUnder Fare groups/services it is very important that we do NOT click in the \"Check all fare groups\" or any\nﬂight segments. - if you do this you will issue the tickets again and we (ETG) will pay for passengers ticket\nagain to the airline. \nOnly check the boxes for the baggage that you want to issue and press next. \nClick on show next to \"forms of payment\". \nWe always have to change the payment method to VAN by pressing the blue/green arrows. \n \nAfter payment method has been manually changed press issue documents: \n8.

After baggage is issued in SPRK we always register errand in Edvin per usual. No need to queue to ticketing\nor UPA TKT- \"Close D365 External portals\" queue as agent has already issued the EMD.  \n10. Send conﬁrmation email to the customer from Edvin and register errand with detailed notes. \nTemplate found in:\nFor ETG orders: First Line \u0000 Others \u0000 Others \u0000 External portal booking details\nFor B.com orders: Booking.com \u0000 First Line \u0000 Other \u0000 External portal booking details\n12. Remove payment link.\nStep 3\nSolution Parent step: 4\nManual Rebooking of partially used tickets.\nIf pnr has been partly used you must follow the below steps. \nCheck the fare rules of the ticket for rebooking conditions. \n1. Add the new \u0000ights in the PNR by selecting “Add air”.\n2. Click on \"One Way\" as you only need to search for the return \u0000ight.\nAdd the departure and arrival airport, rebooking date, and click on \"Air availability\"\n3. Choose the same booking class if available, or if not available, you need to choose the next available\nhigher bookings class, (the fare can't be lower than the original fare.) Click on the shopping cart to add\nthe segments. \n4. Now you need to price the rebooking.\nSelect the \u0000own segment and the new one and click on \"Price\".\n5.  Select \"Current classes\" and ALWAYS click on the checkbox \"Historical pricing\".  \n      Then click on \"Pricing by brands\" (for selecting the correct fare family) & choose the \"Validating Carrier\".\n      Then click on \"Continue\".\n6. At the next step, select the passengers/tickets you want to rebook and click on \"Continue\"\n7. In the next step you need to \u0000ll in the date of issuance of the ticket you want to rebook. You may just click\non the pre-selected date and will be automatically \u0000lled. Click on \"Continue\".\n**ATTENTION** In case the ticket has already been rebooked once you need to double-check the correct date\nof the last round trip ticket that was valid.\n \n8. Next step is the Optional Services. You may skip this step by clicking on Continue.\n9. At the \u0000nal step you should get the pricing.\n***ATTENTION*** If you get the below error message (No fares found for booking class-Try other\noptions) instead of pricing, go back to step 5 and select \"Best Available\". Make sure to again select \"Historical\nPricing\".\nRepeat the process until step 9 and you will get the pricing. \n10. Now you need to compare the fare and taxes (one by one) with the original ticket.\nOriginal ticket New pricing\nIn this example we have:\nNew fare: 208 EUR - Old fare: 162 EUR = 46 EUR Fare di\u0000erence\nNew YQ tax: 3.00 EUR -  Old YQ tax: 3.00 EUR = 0 YQ\nNew YQ tax: 3.00 EUR -  Old YQ tax: 3.00 EUR = 0 YQ\nNew DE tax: 8.44 EUR -  Old DE tax: 8.44 EUR = 0 DE\nNew OY tax: 12.88 EUR -  O", "output": "Summary: (model will learn)"}

Reissued ticket cancellation\n2. Amadeus/ Sabre voluntary reissued ticket\n3. Involuntary reissued ticket\n4. Amadeus involuntary reissued ticket\n5. Sabre Involuntary reissued ticketd\nStep 1 - Starting point\nQuestion No linked steps\nReissued ticket cancellation\n1. Voluntary reissued ticket Step 2\n2. Involuntary reissued ticket Step 3\nStep 2\nSolution Parent step: 1\nAmadeus/ Sabre voluntary reissued ticket\nVoluntary reissued tickets\nBoth GDSs:\nPlease follow these steps in the mentioned order to proceed with handling the voluntary reissued ticket.\n \nCheck the rule of the ticket\nWhen the ticket is voluntarily reissued it is by the choice of the passenger. This means that we need to \ncheck the rule of both the original ticket and the new ticket to determine which penalty to charge for the \nrefund. We have three scenarios:\nScenario 1 - Same penalty in the original ticket and the reissued ticket. Charge one penalty.\nScenario 2 - Di\u0000erent penalties in the original ticket and the reissued ticket. Charge the strictest penalty.\nScenario 3 - The original ticket is nonrefundable and the reissued ticket has a penalty. Add the fare from \nthe original nonrefundable ticket as used and add the penalty for the upgraded part.\nWhat was the change fee?\nThe change fee is never refundable so we need to \u0000gure out how we have paid for the change fee so that \nwe can remove it from the refund mask. Here we also have three scenarios:\nScenario 1 - The change fee has been paid for separately on an EMD\nHere we don't have to think about the change fee in the refund mask, we will just let the EMD be.\nScenario 2 - The change fee has been added as a tax.\nNormal change fee taxes can be CP, OB, OA, XP, DU, BO and OD etc. Check Edvin, for most airlines the \ninformation is updated. Here we delete the applicable tax from the tax display in the refund mask.\nScenario 3 - The change fee is included in the fare of the new ticket.\nIf the amount of the change fee is not speci\u0000ed in the remarks we have to check the rule of the original \nticket to see how much the change fee was. Then we have to add that amount as the fare used in the \nrefund mask.\nStep 3\nQuestion Parent step: 1\nInvoluntary reissued ticket\n1. Amadeus Step 4\n2. Sabre Step 5\nStep 4\nSolution Parent step: 3\nAmadeus involuntary reissued ticket\nIn this example there is no amount after total, instead it says NO ADC which means no additional collect. We \nnow know that there´s been no fare di\u0000erence for this new ticket which indicates an involuntary reissue. It is \nvisible in the bottom of the ticket calculation on the TOTAL amount row.\nBut to be absolutely sure we need to check the remarks and look for an EMD in the PNR. To check, use either \nRTF or RHFA to locate any possible additional EMD and ticket numbers. \nFor involuntary reissued tickets with no ADC the form of payment (FP line, abbreviated to FOP) is always the \nsame as the original ticket.\n \nRefund of involuntary reissued ticket\nWhen a ticket is reissued due to involuntary reasons we always try to \u0000nd seats available in the same class, \nbut if that is not possible the airline might give an authorization to upgrade the ticket. \nThis could mean that the refund rules di\u0000er between the original ticket and the reissued one. However since \nit is not by the choice of the passenger to change the ticket we will always go by the rules of the original ticket \nin this scenario.\nCheck the rules of the original ticket.\nTry to access the original ticket from the history in the PNR using RHFA and TWD/TKT055-XXXXXXXX70. If you \ncannot access the ticket, check the original farebasis with  TTH command. More info on how to display the \nhistory of active/purged PNR can be found here.\nExample on how to retrieve the original ticket issue date.\nWhenever a ticket in Amadeus is reissued due to a previous Schedule change or Force Majeure without an \nadditional collection, eventually we need to cancel the reservation upon the customer’s request according \nto the fare rules:\n1. If the usual ways to check the fare rules do not work(FQP ﬂow, backdate pricing, or FQD command), \nusually that is because the date of issue is incorrect in our command.\n2. To ﬁnd the original ticket date, check the FO line inside the new ticket or the date when the original TST \nwas created:\n\nOr\nLet’s see the diﬀerence:\nAfter trying FQP ﬂow:\n\nOr FQD command:\nFQDFRADLM/ATK/D14SEP22/R,20AUG22/CJ\nNone of the results is matching us.\nBut once we update the date of issuance:\n\nWe get the correct farebasis on option 2.\nNow, we can proceed with retrieving and interpreting the penalty rule.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nIf the refund is due to schedule change or force majeure, you do not need to check the ticket rules.\nStep 5\nSolution Parent step: 3\nSabre Involuntary reissued ticketd\nSabre: \nIn this example there is no amount after total, instead, it says NOADC which means no additional cost has \nbeen collected. \nWe now know that there´s been no fare di\u0000erence for this new ticket which indicates an involuntary reissue. \nBut to be absolutely sure we need to check the remarks and look for an EMD in the PNR. In Sabre, you can \neasily see if you have any EMDs as they will show in the ticket list when you use command *T. They are \nindicated as a ME before the ticket/EMD number.\n\nThere is no EMD in this PNR and according to the remarks on RX-lines and in Edvin order notes, the ticket has \nclearly been reissued due to involuntary reasons (schedule change or force majeure). \n \nRefund of involuntary reissued ticket\nWhen a ticket is reissued due to involuntary reasons we always try to \u0000nd seats available in the same class, \nbut if that is not possible the airline might give us the authorization to upgrade the ticket.

For more information please check the Baggage addition request\n1. Check if the customer added the bag/seat during the booking \u0000ow or post-sale. \n     a) Bag/seat added during the booking \u0000ow. \n          That means that the customer does not receive a separate con\u0000rmation email. The initial con\u0000rmation\nemail includes ALL the relevant information for the itinerary and the purchased add-ons. \nExample:\nInstead of escalating these requests via slack op-supp-ancillaries, open the order in the related system\n(GDS/LCC/portal) to verify the ancillary.  \nInform the customer that the bag/seat was successfully issued and guide him where to \u0000nd this information\nin the con\u0000rmation email. \nATTENTION: When the ancillary is not issued automatically, the order falls to the Manual queue. In this case,\ncheck if the order ended up to the Manual queue and do NOT  escalate the cases through the slack\nchannel op-supp-ancillaries. The ful\u0000llment team handles the orders with priority based on the departure\ndate/time. \nWhen the ancillary is issued manually, the Ful\u0000llment team does not send a separate con\u0000rmation email\nbecause we do not want to confuse the customer since the add-on was purchased in the booking \u0000ow.. \nIf the ancillary cannot be issued, the Ful\u0000llment team places the order to the Refund Dashboard - Tech error\nAncillary, so the payouts team can process the refund only for the product’s value. \n  b) Bag/seat added post sale\nCheck if the order has been placed to the Manual queue. \nIf yes, inform the customer to wait until to receive the con\u0000rmation email from the Ful\u0000llment team. \nIf the order is not in any queue, open the order to the relevant system (GDS/LCC/portal) before escalating\nthe case to the slack channel op-supp-ancillaries to check if the ancillary was added. \nIf the order is not in any queue and the ancillary has not been issued, you have to place the order to the\nrelevant queue and escalate the case to the relevant slack channel op-supp-ancillaries. \nFor the occasions where the Ful\u0000llment team forgot to send the con\u0000rmation email to the customer, you can\nescalate it via slack to the  op-supp-ancillaries. \nStep 9\nSolution Parent step:2\nWheelchair - Portals\nWhen a passenger requests additional support such as a wheelchair, kindly verify its availability through the\nportal. \nIf the service is not accessible, kindly redirect the passenger to the airline.\nStep 10\nSolution Parent step:12\nAPIS (DOCS) - Galileo/Travelport\nPlease check here.\nStep 11\nSolution Parent step:12\nAPIS (DOCS) - Amadeus\nAPIS  stands for Advanced Passenger Information Service\nIf the Customer requests to update the APIS/DOCS information to the booking.\nTake the APIS/DOCS details during the call/chat and update them in GDS/Edvin, do not ask for a passport\ncopy or docs via email for this request.\nIf the customer is not able to provide APIS/DOCS information on call/chat, advise the customer to contact\nus again (highlight the chat option) when they have the necessary details ready or advise the customer\nto update the information via the airline website or at the airport and Assure them that this option will\nnot result in any issues with their travel plans.\nThere are few types of A", "output": "Summary: (model will learn)"}

If a manual calculation is needed, always remember to check the fare rules or the TA\npages.\nStep 3\nSolution Parent step: 1\nManual calculation when ticket has extended validity\nWhen you need to make a manual calculation, and the validity of your ticket is extended according to TA, but\nyou can't \u0000nd any prices to compare with when you're backdating with FXX or FQP. Most tickets are only valid\nfor 1 year maximum so in these cases you need to make a fake return to \u0000nd a price.\n\nThis is a ticket where the outbound is \u0000own, the ticket was issued 06apr21.\nLet's pretend you want to rebook the inbound to 28 Apr next year\nYou pick the same booking class as in the original ticket or the \u0000rst available to the left, in this case, T-class.\n\nThen use the command FXX/r,up,06apr21/s2,3,6,7 for historical pricing (Backdating)\nAnd this is the error message you get:\nThis is because the ticket was issued on 06 Apr and only valid for 1 year.  \nSince the ticket was issued on 06 Apr we need to make a fake inbound for a date as close as possible before\nthat date to get a valid price. You will pick the same booking class as you had available on the requested \u0000ight\n28 Apr, so in this case T-class.\nThen use the command FXX/r,up,06apr21/s2,3,6,7 for historical pricing (Back dating)\nAnd this is the result you get:\n\nNow you can go ahead and do the manual calculation comparing the original ticket with the pricing for the\nfake return price image.\nRemember to be very clear in your notes when sending this to Ticketing.   \nStep 4\nSolution Parent step: 1\nManual calculation for a nego fare ticket\nWhen you need to make a manual calculation, and your ticket is in nego fare, missing fare and total.\nThis is the ticket and it was issued 03jun21:\n\nLet's pretend you want to rebook this inbound to 20 JUN:\nThe ATC is not working, and you need to continue with a manual calculation. You will then use the command\nFXP/R,U/S2,3 (instead of R,UP you will just add R,U to get the “unpublished” prices, called nego fares.). A nego\nticket has to be rebooked to another nego price (there are exceptions, TK for instance) \nThis will be your result:\n\nSince we don't have the fare of the original ticket, then you need to check the TST with the command TQT. If\nyou get this error message, you need to proceed to the TST history with the command TTH.\nNO ACTIVE TST - DELETED TST RECORDS MAY EXIST - PLEASE USE TTH \nIn the TST history, you will \u0000nd all pricing details for the original ticket, and you can go ahead doing your\nmanual calculating comparing old ticket price and today price.\n  \nThis is also possible to use when a PNR is purged, just use RPP/RLC-XXXXXX and then RPP/TTH  \nStep 5\nSolution Parent step: 1\nManual calculation and you are not getting correct fare family\nWhen you need to make a manual calculation, and you are not getting the original fare family when using\nFXX \n\nThis is the ticket, and we have a FB KEUCLSP3, with LH-group CL stands for “classic”. The ticket is including\n1PC.\nLet's pretend we want to rebook the inbound to 30 Aug:\nWe price it with FXX/R;UP/S,4 and this is the result we are getting.\nAs you can see, we have the FB we want on option 2 for the outbound, but the plus sign indicates we have\nanother FB for the inbound. We have classic on outbound and light on inbound as you see further down:\n\nIf you open option 2 with FQQ02 you will see this:\nSo we have no options with classic on OB and IB. But this is easy to change. Use FXX/R,UP/S2,4/FF-CLASSIC and\nyou will \u0000nd the correct FB.\nYou can also use FXX/R,UP/A-KEUCLSP3 with the same result.\n\nYou can use this with every airline that works with fare families, but of course all airlines have their own\nname of di\u0000erent fares, for instance SAS is calling their light ticket GOLIGHT, but it works the same way. \nStep 6\nSolution Parent step: 1\nManual calculation when you receive msg *RB and OB is \u0000own\nWhen you need to make a manual calcul", "output": "Summary: (model will learn)"}

However, we do \nhave cases where there is a technical error in the airline's system, and they have to notify us of a change they \nhave had while the aircraft were still in operation. For such cases, the airline provides us with a special policy \nfor a speciﬁc route and date that we must follow.\nIn the need to inform all parties involved of such errors a new category (Attribute) has been created in the \nEdvin Documents/Schedule Change tab, that will include the proper airline  policy to follow.\nUntil now, the schedule change agent had to check the ﬂight status in GDS to identify the schedule change \nand inform the passenger about the possible alternatives, based on the Edvin Documents for SC Policies. \nNow having in mind the possibility of a technical error, we should follow the below:\n1. Open order in Edvin.\n2. Open PNR in GDS and check ﬂight status and ﬂight number.\n3. Open the Edvin Docs, ﬁrst checking whether there is a new technical error under the attribute ‘Tech \nAlert’ that aﬀects that speciﬁc ﬂight in the PNR for the speciﬁc period mentioned.\na.

Do NOT \"Modify order\" in such a\nscenario, as no refund to the customer. Instead, press \"Cancel Order\" with the reason \"Ticket rules\n- no refund to customer\".\n5.
